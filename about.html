       1. How many species of birds can fly?


        There are about 10,000 living species of birds, almost all of which can fly.
         Flying birds are divided into 29 orders. The most common orders include landfowl, 
            waterfowl, shorebirds, diurnal and nocturnal raptors, parrots, and perching birds.</pre>

            Kakapos: The Flightless Parrot You've Never Heard Off - C.S.W.D
            Kakapo are missing a part of their body that other flying birds
            have called the keel. The keep is attached to the sternum and 
            works directly with the flight muscles, as they normally attach 
            to the keel. They also have very little wings. So, Kakapo are flightless.</pre>

            Featured Creature: Kakapo | Blog | Nature | PBS
            Perhaps due to their slow metabolism, kakapos are long-lived compared to other birds.
            A large number of birds are over 30 years old and the oldest is thought to be over 100!
            Because they live so long, they go through adolescent period of at least several 
            years before breeding
