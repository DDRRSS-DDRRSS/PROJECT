    <pre class="pre">There are 10,000 species of bird. There are around 10,000 different species of bird. 
        They range from big to small, and are lots of different colours!</pre>
    <pre class="pre">Birds are part of the balance of nearly every ecosystem on the planet. Birds eat insects and plants,
         and bird eggs are food for may other animals. 
         Fruit-eating birds help spread seeds, 
          nectar-eating birds pollinate flowers. 
          Birds have long been considered an important part of human culture.</pre>
       <pre class="pre">   1. It typically takes 20–60 minutes for birds to lay an egg,
        though there are exceptions says Mike Toms. Geese and turkeys take 
         longer, while many nest parasites are able to lay incredibly quickly.
          Cuckoos for example average just 10 seconds


        2. Emperor penguins can dive to depths of hundreds of metres. 
         Penguins are able to dive so deep because of unique adaptions
          to their cardiovascular system. As they prepare to dive their 
          heart starts to race and the penguin hyperventilates, which primes 
          its muscles with oxygen. Then it dives in and does something, well,
           breathtaking: it cuts off the blood supply to its muscles to 
           conserve dissolved oxygen for the rest of its body.
        
        3. Some birds, individuals and species, are monogamous 
        and mate for life. Examples include mute swans, black 
        vultures, albatrosses and puffins

        4. Flamingoes are pink on the inside as well as the outside.
        Their pinkness is caused by the presence of carotenoid pigments 
        found in the algae and crustaceans that make up the diet of a flamingo.
         Though the pink coloration is most obvious in a flamingo’s plumage,
         the carotenoids also impregnate the bird’s tissues, skin, blood 
         and even egg yolk.
        
        
        5. Humans are to blame for at least 600 bird extinctions 
         causing untold damage to ecosystems. Human interference 
          nature has not only caused the extinction of hundreds of bird 
          species but has also caused fundamental changes in the roles 
          that birds play in the global environment.
        
        6. The oldest wild bird in the world is widely thought to 
        be the rather remarkable Laysan albatross known as Wisdom, 
        who lives on the Midway Atoll in the North Pacific Ocean and is 
        now estimated to be in her early to mid
         seventies.

        7. Vast numbers of fast-moving birds are able to fly in close
         proximity to each other and co-ordinate changes of direction thanks
          to their  sensory systems that detect position and movement accurately,
          and on rapid responses that co-ordinate directional changes.
           Physicists studying starling flocks in Rome discovered each
            bird monitors its position by interacting with a sample of
             neighbours at varying distances. 
        
        8. When it slams its beak into a tree in search of grubs, 
        a woodpecker experiences g-forces twenty times what would likely
         lead to traumatic brain injuries in humans. And it does it
          12,000 times a day, day after day, without as much as a headache.
           It survives the experience with its marbles intact because of a
            remarkable tongue, which works as a safety belt for the braincase.
             Other features of the skull that prevent brain damage include
              shock absorbers at the base of the beak that cushion the brain 
              from the impact forces.
        
        
        9. Some birds have a sense of self awareness. If you looked into a
         mirror and thought your reflection was somebody else, you’d fail the
          mirror test. To recognise that the image was you, you’d have to understand
           that ‘you’ are a being. You’d be self-aware. And when some bird
            species were tested the magpie and the domestic pigeon passed, 
            while parrots, jackdaws and carrion crows failed.
        
        10. Birds don't sweat and do not have sweat glands, so to 
        stay cool they evaporate water through their respiratory
         tract. Watch a bird on a hot summer's day and you may see
          it panting or, in some species, rapidly moving the floor 
          of its mouth (termed a 'gular flutter').
        
        11. Birds don't pee as they need to stay as light as possible.
         Among their myriad adaptations to do so is the design of their
          excretory system. Producing pee as well as poo, as mammals do
          , means you’re going to be retaining urine (which consists of
           nitrogen-rich urea diluted with lots of water) in a bladder.
            This isn’t very helpful if you are trying to keep your weight
             down. So, instead of excreting waste matter as both urine and
              faeces, birds (with the exception of the ostrich) ditch their
               waste in one go through an opening called the cloaca.
        
        
        12. The strongest bird in the world is the black wheatear, 
        which lives on the cliffs and rocky slopes of Iberia and
        western North Africa. This small insectivorous bird would get the 
        gold in the bird weightlifting Olympics! The males decorate 
        the outside of their nest holes, and sometimes their nests, with stones, 
        some of which can weigh up to two-thirds of their bodyweight 
        according to research.
        
        swordbilled hummingbird

        13. Bird beaks not get much longer than the aptly-named swordbilled 
        . This bird’s amazing beak, which can reach lengths of about 12cm, 
        is longer than its body, allowing it to access nectar from the longest,
         thinnest blooms that other hummingbird beaks can’t reach.
        
        This extraordinary beak earned the swordbilled hummingbird 
        the title of longest bird beak and a place on our weirdest 
        birds list and our weirdest bird beak list
        
        14. The smallest bird in the world is the bee hummingbird, 
        which clocks in at just 5.5cm in length (for males, females
         are slightly larger at around 6.1 cm). This also makes them
          the smallest warm-blooded vertebrate.
        
        
        15. The loudest bird in the world is the male white bellbird,
         a curious Amazonian species that produces an ear-splitting sound
          something like the two-tone horn of a fast train approaching a station.
        
        
        16. It’s not just parrots that can talk. Starlings, mynahs,
         Australian magpies, lyrebirds, bowerbirds and corvids can all
          mimic human speech. Even a captive Australian musk duck hit
           the news in 2021 when it was recorded saying “You bloody fool”.
        
        17. There's a bird that can walk on water - sort of! Jacanas 
        possess preposterously long toes relative to body size that 
        spread the birds’ weight, enabling them to walk on floating 
        vegetation, such as lilypads, without sinking. This talent 
        has earned them the nickname ‘lily trotters’.
        
        18. In 1932, Australia declared war on 20,000 emus -  – and lost.
        
        What do Andean condors look like
        19. The biggest bird of prey is the Andean Condor . 
        With a wingspan (for the record) maxing out at around 
        3.2m, and weighing up to 15kg the Andean condor is also
         the heaviest bird of prey in the world and the raptor 
         with the longest wingspan. It also stands an impressive 
         1.2 metres tall.
        
        
        20. The heaviest flying bird is the kori bustard, which 
        can weigh from 11–19kg. The kori bustard lives in eastern 
        and southern Africa, and can live for over 30 years. Because 
        of its tremendous weight, a kori bustard uses a lot of energy
         to fly, so it will only take off when necessary.
        
        21. Bird poo is white because it contain materials from the
         excretory (uterine) and alimentary (faces) systems, a result 
         of the two emptying into the cloaca, where the reproductive 
         system also has an opening. Whereas the faces contain undigested 
         food remains, and so tend to reflect the diet in general
          composition, the urine is responsible for the white appearance 
          seen in many bird droppings.
        
        22. The most intelligent bird is the grey parrots. Grey parrots
         can not only talk, count and dance in rhythm, but according to
          new research that uses nothing more complicated than a couple 
          of cups and a piece of walnut, they also have the reasoning 
          abilities of a three-year-old child.
        
        23. Although there are a few birds that enter a state of
         suspended animation that is called ‘torpor’, there is 
         only one bird that is known to be a true hibernator: North
          America’s common poorwill. This beautifully camouflaged 
          nocturnal bird is a relative of the nightjar found in Britain
          , and in winter often hibernates among rocks. It can slash
           its oxygen intake by 90 per cent, while its body 
            plummets to 5°C, barely registering signs of life.
        
        
        24. A chicken once lived for 18 months without a head.
         When a chicken’s head is chopped off, the severed nerves
          send impulses to the muscles of the legs and wings, 
          which can cause the remainder of the bird to run around in a flap.      
        Usually this lasts seconds, but in 1945 in the US, 
        a bird dubbed ‘Miracle Mike the Headless Chicken’ 
        famously lived 18 months after its head was removed.
        Headless animals: Can animals survive without their heads? 
        Here's some that do — at least for a while

        25. The (aptly named) bohemian waxwing gorges on so many
         fermented rowan berries in winter that it gets a tad tipsy
          and is unable to fly or even walk in a straight line.
        
        26. Hummingbirds are the only birds that can fly backwards,
        a skill which comes in handy when feeding on the nectar of plants and insects.
        
        27. The Arctic tern has the longest migration journey
         in the world. After breeding in the far north, it heads
          to the opposite end of the globe to enjoy the southern
           hemisphere’s summer. As the crow flies, this would be
            12,000km each way, but the terns take a more meandering 
            route. One tagged individual clocked nearly 97,000km for
             the round trip.
        
        
        28. Some albatrosses are lesbians. When males are scarce,
         the female Laysan albatrosses of Hawaii will partner up 
         to raise young. Young females tend to be the adventurous 
         ones, whereas males remain at their birth colony, which 
         leaves fresh colonies with a shortage of males. Being a
          single parent is not an option, however so these innovative
           females have adapted by soliciting another albatross’ 
           husband as sperm donor, then partnering with a female 
           to raise the chick.
        
        29. Birds can count the number of eggs in their nest. Most 
        birds sense when their clutch is complete via tactile stimulation
         of their brood patch, the featherless area on their bellies that
          warms the eggs. But there is evidence that some bird species 
          count their eggs by sight.
        
        30.  Did you know there are poisonous birds? In fact 
        there's a few of them. Birds were the last major group 
        of vertebrates in which poison or venom was identified 
        by scientists, though local people had long known that
         some birds taste foul and cause numbness if handled. 
         Poisonous bird species include the hooded pitohui and 
         the blue-capped ifrita – and ornithologists think 
         there may be more poisonous birds out there.
        
        
        Toco Toucan, the bird with the largest beak
        31. The bird with the biggest beak, relative
        to body size, is the toco toucan, whose gaudy 
        beak accounts for up to a third of its body surface area.
        
        32. Male birds don't have penises, or rather 97% don't.
         This inevitably means that sperm cannot be deposited 
         within the body of a female. Instead, when a male bird
          mounts a female, sperm is transferred by what is known
           as a ‘cloacal kiss’, which may last only a few seconds. 
           The female then draws the sperm up into her reproductive 
           tract to fertilise her eggs.
